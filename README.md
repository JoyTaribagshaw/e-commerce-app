This is a modern e-commerce application built with the latest web technologies.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A next-generation frontend tooling.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Running

1.  Clone the repo (you will need to create a new repository on GitHub first).
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
    ```sh
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
    ```
3.  Install NPM packages.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the development server.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your browser to see the application.

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized production-ready files.
